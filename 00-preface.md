#Preface
A drop is good in a sea, Damla dənizdə yaxşıdır,
There is no sea without a drop. Damlasız dəniz olmaz.
If a drop will leave a sea, Damla dənizdən ayrılsa,
In sands it will be lost. Qumlarda pünhan olar.
Rasul Rza

Examining the same objective process or event using different methods may lead to creation of sharply different views - real systems and corresponding real-life notions. 
We can bring as an example an interesting conclusion by Ackoff (Russell Lincoln Ackoff, 1919–2009). An architect may view the apparetment buidling as a big system together with electricity lines, heating equipment and water pipeline systems. A heating technology engineer in contrast may view the hearing equipment as a whole system, considering the building as the surrounding environment. Psychology specialist views the building as an environment surrounding the family, and the family itself as a big system for research. For them mutual relations between electrical and heating equipment systems does not have any importance, while for an architect those perhaps are important matters. In short, one should be very carefull when determining the system to be studied and the border between it and the surrounding environment.
In 30s, L.Bertalanffy (Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy, 1901–1972) proposed the idea of systemic analysis, which suggested determining the characteristics of an object based on the characteristics of its components.
